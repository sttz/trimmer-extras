# Bundled Options
Trimmer is mainly a Framework that lets you easily create your own Options but it also comes with a few bundled Options to get you started. You can use these Options as starting point to create your own or modify them to suit your needs.

* [OptionBuildSettings](bundled/build_settings.md)
* [OptionIniFile](bundled/ini_file.md)
* [OptionPrompt](bundled/prompt.md)
* [OptionVersion](bundled/version.md)
* [OptionXcode](bundled/xcode.md)
