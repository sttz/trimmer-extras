# OptionXcode

[Source Documentation](xref:sttz.Trimmer.Options.OptionXcode)

This Option patches the Xcode project for iOS builds.

### Force Disable Remote Notifications

Some Unity version contain an annoying bug where it misdetects if the project uses remote notifications and enables them. This causes a warning email to be sent from iTunes Connect for every uploaded build.

Enabling this Option force-disables remote notifications in the built Xcode project. Of course, this should only be enabled if the project really doesn't use remote notifications.

### Add Encryption Exemption

All apps uploaded to the App Store and distributed outside the USA need to follow US export regulations regrading encryption technology.

Enabling this Option adds a flag in the Info.plist, indicating that the App only uses encryption that is exempt from the export restrictions. This will remove the need to manually provide this information for every build in iTunes Connect.

Only enable this Option if you're sure you comply with US export regulations.

### Rename Scheme

All Xcode projects generated by Unity use a scheme named "Unity-iPhone". This makes it hard to tell them apart, especially in the organizer for archived builds, where you get a lot of "Unity-iPhone" entries in the side bar.

This Option will rename the scheme to the product name you entered in Player Settings. This will display the name in Xcode's title bar's scheme selection and in the organizer.
